- **Type:** Sorcery
- **Oracle Text:** As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a creature. Search your library for a creature card with mana value X or less, where X is 2 plus the sacrificed creature's mana value. Put that card onto the battlefield, then shuffle. Exile Eldritch Evolution.

- **Mana Cost:** {5}{R}{R}
- **Type:** Legendary Creature — Elder Dinosaur

- **Oracle Text:** (Front) Trample. When Etali enters, each player exiles cards from the top of their library until they exile a nonland card. You may cast any number of spells from among the nonland cards exiled this way without paying their mana costs. {9}{G/P}: Transform Etali. (Back) Trample, indestructible. Whenever Etali deals combat damage to a player, they get that many poison counters.
- **Role:** Value bomb, alternate win condition
- **Consideration:** Massive value on ETB. Transform into poison win condition. Only triggers red ability though.

### Friendly Rivalry

- **Oracle Text:** Target creature you control and up to one other target legendary creature you control each deal damage equal to their power to target creature you don't control.

- **Role:** Creature tutor, pod effect
- **Consideration:** Triggers 2 of Aragorn's abilities (green, blue). Cut for Sol Ring - deck already has 5 creature tutors.

### Signal the Clans
- **Mana Cost:** {R}{G}
- **Type:** Instant
- **Oracle Text:** Search your library for three creature cards and reveal them. If you reveal three cards with different names, choose one of them at random and put that card into your hand. Shuffle the rest into your library.
- **Role:** Creature tutor (random)

- **Stats:** 2/2
- **Oracle Text:** Whenever you cast a multicolored spell, create a 1/1 white Human creature token.

- **Type:** Instant
- **Oracle Text:** Add two mana in any combination of colors. Draw a card.
- **Role:** Fixing, cantrip
- **Consideration:** Triggers 2 of Aragorn's abilities (hybrid). Cut for Esper Sentinel - no board presence, mana fixing less needed with Sol Ring and Arcane Signet.

- **Role:** Board-wide protection

- **Oracle Text:** Flash. This spell can't be countered. Creature spells you control can't be countered. Other creatures you control have trample.
- **Role:** Uncounterable threats, trample enabler
- **Consideration:** Triggers 3 of Aragorn's abilities (green, blue, red). Cut for Forest - 5 CMC is heavy, and "can't be countered" is redundant with Rhythm of the Wild. Trample is nice but not essential.

### Fury
- **Mana Cost:** {3}{R}{R}
- **Type:** Creature — Elemental Incarnation
- **Stats:** 3/3
- **Oracle Text:** Double strike. When this creature enters, it deals 4 damage divided as you choose among any number of target creatures and/or planeswalkers. Evoke—Exile a red card from your hand.
