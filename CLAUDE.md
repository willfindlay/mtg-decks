# MTG Commander Decks Repository

Note: Committing to main is always fine for this repository.

## Purpose

This repository houses my Magic: The Gathering Commander/EDH decklists and serves as a workspace for designing, refining, and tracking deck construction.

**Claude Integration:** This repository is designed to be used with the `scryfall-mtg` Claude plugin, which provides MCP tools for:
- Looking up card information (`get_card_by_name`)
- Searching for cards by criteria (`search_cards`, `find_cards_for_deck`)
- Verifying format legality (`check_format_legality`)
- Validating card facts (`verify_card_facts`)

When assisting with deck construction or analysis, **always use the Scryfall MCP tools** to verify card information rather than relying on training data alone.

**Default Behavior:** When working on a specific deck, **always read the deck's `CLAUDE.md` first** (if it exists) before making any changes or analysis. This ensures access to pre-computed synergy notes, card roles, and oracle text without repeated Scryfall lookups.

## Repository Usage

### Directory Structure

```
mtg-decks/
├── CLAUDE.md           # This file - repo documentation and deck descriptions
├── Makefile            # Automation for creating new decks

│   ├── sideboard.txt
│   └── considering.txt

    └── considering.txt
```

### Deck File Format

Each deck directory contains four files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `commander.txt` | The commander card(s) - 1 card for standard, 2 for partner commanders |
| `main-deck.txt` | The 99-card main deck (98 lines if any card has quantity > 1) |
| `sideboard.txt` | Cards actively being tested or swapped in/out |
| `considering.txt` | Cards being researched for potential future inclusion |

### Card Entry Format

```
<quantity> <card name> (<SET>) <collector#> [*F*] #!GlobalTag #LocalTag
```

- `<quantity>` - Number of copies (usually 1 for Commander singleton)
- `<card name>` - Full card name
- `(<SET>)` - Set code in parentheses
- `<collector#>` - Collector number
- `*F*` - Optional foil marker
- `#!Tag` - **Global tag** - applies universally across all decks (e.g., `#!Ramp`)
- `#Tag` - **Local tag** - deck-specific, only meaningful in context of this deck (e.g., `#Multi Coloured Matters`)

### Card Tags

**Global Tags** (`#!`) - Universal categories that apply to any Commander deck:

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `#!Land` | Mana-producing lands |
| `#!Ramp` | Mana acceleration (dorks, rocks, land fetch) |
| `#!Card Advantage` | Draw, selection, or card generation |
| `#!Removal` | Targeted permanent destruction/exile |
| `#!Interaction` | Responses to opponents' plays |
| `#!Protection` | Protects your board or commander |
| `#!Tutor` | Searches library for specific cards |
| `#!Board Wipe` | Mass removal effects |
| `#!Countermagic` | Spell negation |
| `#!Fixing` | Mana color fixing |

**Local Tags** (`#`) - Deck-specific categories (examples):

| Tag | Deck | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `#Win Condition` | Any | Cards that close out the game (varies by strategy) |
| `#Multi Coloured Matters` | Aragorn | Payoffs for casting multicolored spells |

### Creating a New Deck

```bash
make new NAME=<deck-name>
```

This copies the `template/` directory to create a new deck with empty files.

### Generating Deck Card Reference

Use the `/deck-info` command to generate or update a deck-level CLAUDE.md with detailed card information:

```
/deck-info <deck-name>
```

This fetches card data from Scryfall and creates a comprehensive card reference. If the file already exists, only new cards are looked up.

### Deck-Level CLAUDE.md Format

Each deck can have an optional `CLAUDE.md` file containing detailed card information from Scryfall. This file is generated by `/deck-info` and follows this format:

```markdown
# <Deck Name> - Card Reference

## Commander

### <Card Name>
- **Mana Cost:** {X}{Y}{Z}
- **Type:** <Type Line>
- **Stats:** <Power/Toughness if creature>
- **Oracle Text:** <Full oracle text>
- **Commander Synergy:** <How this card interacts with the commander>

## Creatures

### <Card Name>
- **Mana Cost:** {X}{Y}
- **Type:** <Type Line>
- **Stats:** <P/T>
- **Oracle Text:** <Text>
- **Role:** <Brief description of role in deck>
- **Synergies:** <Notable interactions with other cards>

## Instants
<Same format, omit Stats>

## Sorceries
<Same format, omit Stats>

## Enchantments
<Same format, omit Stats>

## Artifacts
<Same format, omit Stats>

## Lands
<Same format - simplified, just name and abilities>

## Sideboard
<Same format as above based on card type>

## Considering
<Same format as above based on card type>
```

**Card Entry Guidelines:**
- Always include mana cost with proper pip notation: `{W}`, `{U}`, `{B}`, `{R}`, `{G}`, `{C}`, `{X}`, `{2}`, etc.
- Hybrid mana: `{W/U}`, `{R/G}`, etc.
- Phyrexian mana: `{W/P}`, `{U/P}`, etc.
- Include full oracle text for non-obvious cards
- For lands, just list the name and mana-producing abilities
- Synergies should reference specific cards in the deck by name
- Commander Synergy should explain how the card triggers or benefits from the commander

### Deck Planning Workflow

1. **Choose Commander** - Add to `commander.txt`
2. **Define Strategy** - Identify primary win conditions and synergies
3. **Research Cards** - Use Scryfall MCP tools to find candidates, add to `considering.txt`
4. **Build Initial List** - Move cards to `main-deck.txt`, targeting:
   - 34-38 lands
   - 8-12 ramp sources
   - 8-12 card draw sources
   - 8-12 removal/interaction
   - 3-5 win conditions
   - Fill remaining slots with synergy pieces
5. **Verify Legality** - Use `check_format_legality` on all cards
6. **Iterate** - Test, swap cards between `main-deck.txt` and `sideboard.txt`
7. **Document** - Update the deck's section in this CLAUDE.md

### Maintaining This File

When decks are added, modified, or removed:
1. Add/update the corresponding subsection in "Deck Descriptions" below
2. Keep commander info, strategy summary, and key combos current
3. Update power level assessment if deck changes significantly
4. Note any budget constraints or theme restrictions

## Commander Format Reference

### Basic Rules

- **Deck Size:** Exactly 100 cards (including commander)
- **Singleton:** Maximum 1 copy of any card except basic lands
- **Commander:** A legendary creature (or planeswalker with "can be your commander")
- **Color Identity:** Every card must match the commander's color identity
- **Starting Life:** 40 life
- **Commander Damage:** 21 combat damage from a single commander is lethal
- **Command Zone:** Commander starts in command zone, can be cast from there
- **Commander Tax:** Costs {2} more for each previous cast from command zone

### Color Identity Rules

Color identity includes:
- Mana symbols in mana cost
- Mana symbols in rules text (including reminder text)
- Color indicators

**Important:**
- Hybrid mana `{W/U}` requires BOTH colors in commander's identity
- Phyrexian mana `{W/P}` requires that color in identity
- Colorless cards (artifacts, Eldrazi) are legal in any deck
- Lands producing off-color mana are illegal

### Power Level Brackets

| Bracket | Description | Tutors | Fast Mana | Win Turn | Budget |
|---------|-------------|--------|-----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Precon/Casual | 0-2 | Minimal | 10-15 | $50-150 |
| 2 | Optimized Casual | 3-5 | Some | 8-12 | $150-500 |
| 3 | High Power | 5-8 | Yes | 6-9 | $500-2000 |
| 4 | cEDH | 8+ | All | 3-5 | $2000+ |

### Deckbuilding Best Practices

**Mana Base:**
- 34-38 lands depending on curve and ramp density
- Include lands that produce multiple colors
- Avoid too many tap-lands in higher power decks
- Consider utility lands (card draw, removal, protection)

**Ramp (8-12 sources):**
- 1-2 CMC ramp is most efficient
- Land ramp (Cultivate, Kodama's Reach) is resilient
- Artifact ramp (Sol Ring, signets) is fast but vulnerable
- Creature ramp (dorks) enables early plays but dies to wraths

**Card Advantage (8-12 sources):**
- Repeatable draw engines are premium
- One-shot draw spells fill gaps
- Card selection (scry, surveil) smooths draws

**Removal/Interaction (8-12 sources):**
- Mix of targeted removal and board wipes
- Include instant-speed interaction
- Have answers for multiple permanent types
- Counterspells protect your gameplan

**Win Conditions (3-5):**
- Have a primary strategy aligned with commander
- Include backup win conditions
- Avoid being one-dimensional

**Curve Considerations:**
- Average CMC of 3.0-3.5 is typical for Commander
- Ensure early plays (turns 1-3)
- Don't overload on high-CMC spells

## Deck Descriptions

### Aragorn, the Uniter

**Commander:** [Aragorn, the Uniter](https://scryfall.com/card/ltr/192) ({R}{G}{W}{U})

A 4-mana 5/5 legendary Human Noble with four triggered abilities:
- **White spell:** Create a 1/1 white Human Soldier token
- **Blue spell:** Scry 2
- **Red spell:** Deal 3 damage to target opponent
- **Green spell:** Target creature gets +4/+4 until end of turn

**Strategy:** Multicolored spellslinger/value engine. The deck maximizes Aragorn's triggers by casting multicolored spells that hit multiple triggers simultaneously. A single 3-color charm triggers three of Aragorn's abilities at once.

**Power Level:** Bracket 2-3 (Optimized Casual to High Power)
- 5 tutors
- Premium mana base (fetches, shocks, triomes)
- Heavy interaction suite
- No infinite combos
- Estimated win turns: 8-12

**Key Synergies:**

| Theme | Cards | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Multi-Color Payoffs | General Ferrous Rokiric, Hero of Precinct One, Knight of New Alara, Fallaji Wayfarer | Reward casting multicolored spells |
| Token Generation | Divine Visitation, Jinnie Fay, Jetmir | Aragorn's soldier tokens become 4/4 angels or pump the whole team |
| Charm Suite | Boros, Brokers, Cabaretti, Izzet, Jeskai, Naya, Simic, Temur Charms | Each triggers 2-3 of Aragorn's abilities |
| LOTR Tribal | Arwen, Boromir, Éomer, Éowyn, Faramir (x2), Pippin | Flavorful synergy package |
| Protection | Teferi's Protection, Heroic Intervention, Deflecting Swat, counterspells, Greaves/Boots | 15 cards protecting the commander |

**Notable Combos:**
- **Aragorn + Divine Visitation:** Every white spell creates a 4/4 flying angel instead of a 1/1
- **Aragorn + Jetmir:** Wide token board becomes lethal with trample and double strike
- **Congregation at Dawn + Aragorn:** Stack deck with multicolored creatures for maximum triggers

**Mana Base:** 34 lands including fetch/shock package, triomes, horizon lands, and utility lands (Boseiju, Minas Tirith, Yavimaya)
